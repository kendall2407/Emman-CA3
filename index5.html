    <h1>The explanation of your thoughts about the impacts and benefits of these technologies to help to promote a green environment.</h1>
    <h3>Why I think that solar panels and wind turbines can help promote a green enviroment:</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>It uses renewable energy</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy.
              Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available</li>
            <li>Wind power is a popular, sustainable, renewable energy source that has a much smaller impact on the environment than burning fossil fuels.</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <br><br>
      <li><strong>Both Solar and wind power do not release harmful pollutants or greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide into the air and water supply and have fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    <p><strong><font size="+1">
      Overall, both sources are much better for the enviroment than fossil fuels such as coal,natural gas,petroleum and orimulsion. Increasing the usage
      of these sources of energy can help slowdown the greenhouse effect and help combat climate change.

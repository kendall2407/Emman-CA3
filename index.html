  <h3><b>The greenhouse effect</b></h3>
  <p>The greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when gases in Earth's atmosphere trap the Sun's heat. This process makes Earth much warmer than it would be without an atmosphere.
    The greenhouse effect is one of the things that makes Earth a comfortable place to live.<br><br><img src="thegreenhouseeffect.jpg" alt="Greenhouse image" width="500" height="300"></p>

  <h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>
  <p>Carbon dioxide, (CO2), a colourless gas having a faint sharp odour and a sour taste. It is one of the most important greenhouse gases linked to global warming, but it is a minor component of Earth’s atmosphere (about 3 volumes in 10,000), formed
    in combustion of carbon-containing materials, in fermentation, and in respiration of animals and employed by plants in the photosynthesis of carbohydrates. The presence of the gas in the atmosphere keeps some of the radiant energy received by
    Earth from being returned to space, thus producing the so-called greenhouse effect.</p>


  <h3>What caused Carbon Dioxide's impact to increase to a dangerously high level:</h3>
  <p>Greenhouse gases have kept Earth's climate habitable for humans and millions of other species by trapping heat from the sun.
    However, those gases have become out of balance, threatening to significantly alter any living creature that can lives on this planet and where they can survive.
    Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, the most hazardous and prevalent greenhouse gas, are at record highs.
    The main reason for the high amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is that humans have released them into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.
    Rather than allowing heat to escape into space, the gases absorb solar energy and hold it near to Earth's surface.
    The greenhouse effect is the result of this heat trapping.</p>

  <h3>Harmful effects of carbon dioxide to the enviroment:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Causes climate change by trapping heat in our atmosphere</li>
    <li>Ice is melting worldwide, especially at the Earth’s north and south poles. This includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering West Antarctica and Greenland, and Arctic sea ice.Much of this melting ice contributes to sea-level rise. Global
      sea levels are rising 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year. The rise is occurring at a faster rate in recent years and is predicted to accelerate in the coming decades.</li>
    <li>Rising temperatures are affecting wildlife and their habitats. Vanishing ice has challenged species such as the Adélie penguin in Antarctica, where some populations on the western peninsula have collapsed by 90 percent or more.</li>

  <h3>The use of technologies to promote a low carbon economy</h3>
  <p>Energy efficiency refers to using less energy to perform the same task - that is, eliminating energy waste. Energy efficiency brings a variety of benefits: reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing demand for energy imports, and lowering our
    costs on a household and economy-wide level. Two thirds of industrial energy consumption goes into heat applications, but the focus is often on electricity. With increasing energy intensity, the importance of heat applications for decarbonization
    in companies increases.</p>
